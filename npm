To install npm modules :
Locally-We can use in current project only.
npm i <package name>
Globally-We can use it in any project.
npm install -g <package name>
sudo npm install -g <package name>(for mac

package.json file: stores important data about the current project 
manual approach is to create package.json in root and create properties 
OR step by step npm init 
npm init -y
In package.json
We have dependencies property(object) and inside that object we have an package called Lodash
